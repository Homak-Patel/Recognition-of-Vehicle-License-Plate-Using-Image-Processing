Sep 2020 – Dec 2020 <br />
Summary: Designed a Program which recognizes License Plate. <br />
◦ Also created a Database which contains all the information of owner of Vehicle and so after recognizing
License plate it gives this information as an output. <br />
◦ System is designed using Python Language and the libraries like OpenCV is used for Image 
Processing. Also applied some of the machine learning algorithms and techniques like KNN – algorithm.<br />
Skills Used: Python , Computer Vision , Image Processing , Machine Learning <br />
Team Size: 3 <br />
Key Outcomes: Created & Designed a Program which recognizes Licence Plate with an accuracy of 84% <br />
